1. My UI library is shadcn (not shadcn-ui which is deprecated)
2. My framework is Next.js 15 with app router
3. My language is TypeScript for all new code
4. Development server is already running, never start another instance
5. Always use "await" with dynamic Next.js APIs (params, searchParams, cookies(), headers()) in Server Components
6. Don't create duplicate files, modify existing ones when same base name exists
7. Follow kebab-case naming for files and folders
8. Place components in appropriate directories (components/, lib/, app/)
9. Implement proper loading and error states for all UI components
10. Use proper error handling with try-catch blocks
